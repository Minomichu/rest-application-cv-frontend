# Frontend CV

Created with Node.js, Gulp, SASS and Fetch API.


Shares its CSS-file with the admin-page since they were planned to look almost the same, though focus on design is on admin page.

As for both CV-frontend and CV-admin it would’ve been better to print out almost everything in JavaScript, but that didn’t hit me until right before the finishing line and too much HTML already was involved.
